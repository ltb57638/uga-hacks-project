"Mei-Chun Jau for HuffPost Amanda Painter is the sole survivor of a May 16 shooting by her ex-husband, Justin Painter. DENTON, Texas ― Amanda Painter sat at the kitchen table in an unfamiliar apartment with an absurd dilemma: She had nothing to wear to a vigil for her three dead children. Her clothes were at home, but her home was now a crime scene. Less than 100 hours after her children were murdered, Amanda, 29, found herself in a Walmart, hobbling down the aisles, the gunshot wound to her neck concealed by a gauze bandage. She found a suitable purple",|

"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and fellow Democrats better grow a pair in battling President Donald Trump, Jim Carrey suggests in his latest artwork. The actor-turned-political-artist posted a painting on Twitter Friday showing a donkey kicking Schiff while his pants are down. “A word to the castrato Adam Schiff and other Democrats: If you can’t win a PR war against this mobbed up, dirty, rotten Cheeto, then you need to get out of politics,” Carrey wrote. A word to the castrato Adam Schiff and other Democrats: If you can’t win a PR war against this mobbed up, dirty, rotten Cheeto, then",|
"Actor Morgan Freeman spoke out again in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him, saying Friday that he was “devastated” by the turn of events. Several women accused the Oscar winner of inappropriate behavior, including lewd comments and unwanted touching, according to a CNN investigation. “I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Morgan said in a statement sent to media, according to outlets. “All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But",|
"How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally. Any reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was",|
"Actor Mike Myers is currently starring with Margot Robbie in the film “Terminal,” and after about a five-year break from films, it looks like he’s here to stay. In an interview with People, Myers says he’s having the “happiest time” of his life raising his three kids, but that even they are eager for him to get back into movies, specifically as his character Austin Powers. The “Saturday Night Live” alum, who turned 55 on Friday, last played the British spy in 2002′s “Goldmember.” Myers said it was his son Spike who asked him if there was going to be",|
"Streamline recommends “Moonrise Kingdom” as the movie you should watch on Hulu this week. The service adds this on Sept. 16. “Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola. The two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way. Although the",|
"Justin Timberlake paid a visit Friday to victims of last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. He dropped in at an area hospital where victims were recovering from the shooting at Santa Fe High School, in which a gunman killed 10 people and injured 13 last Friday. The visit came a couple days after the pop icon performed a concert in nearby Houston in which he donned a “Santa Fe Strong” shirt, the Houston Chronicle reported. A Facebook post from Sonia Lopez-Puentes, the mother of injured student Sarah Salazar, shows a picture of Timberlake with Salazar at the hospital",|
"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday to discuss Kim’s possible upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, the South said, the second inter-Korean summit in as many months. Moon and Kim met just north of the heavily militarised border in the afternoon to exchange views to pave way for a summit between North Korea and the United States, South Korea’s presidential office said. Moon will announce the outcome of his two-hour meeting with Kim on Sunday morning, officials said. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Soyoung Kim; Editing by Alison",|
"NEGUAC, Canada ― When the harbors aren’t frozen, Maxime Daigle and his older brother Jean-Francois often take to the cold waters off New Brunswick in one of their family’s flat-bottomed boats to harvest oysters. The siblings are among hundreds of producers along this rocky coast who grow oysters for La Maison BeauSoleil in the company’s distinctive floating bags. For the Daigles this is a family business. Maxime’s father, Maurice, co-owns La Maison BeauSoleil, an oyster grower, packer and distributor that he runs with his business partner, Amédée Savoie, whose son, Allain Savoie, also works in the company. When the business",|
"Tens of thousands of children from Central America are apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border each year, straining the government system caring for minors traveling to the U.S. without their parents. Now Donald Trump’s administration is stretching the system even further. Until recently, families that illegally crossed together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But as of this month, the Trump administration is following a blanket policy of referring for prosecution all people who cross illegally. The change means that authorities send parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Services and their children wind up in the same agency",|
"The FBI has obtained secret wiretaps collected by Spanish police of conversations involving Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank who has forged close ties with U.S. lawmakers and the National Rifle Association, that led to a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during the gun lobby’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., in May 2016, a top Spanish prosecutor said Friday. José Grinda, who has spearheaded investigations into Spanish organized crime, said that bureau officials in recent months requested and were provided transcripts of wiretapped conversations between Torshin and Alexander Romanov, a convicted Russian money launderer. On the wiretaps,",|
"It’s clear Donald Trump is a huge fan of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But whistleblower Edward Snowden says Americans shouldn’t get their hopes up that special counsel Robert Mueller is going to nail the U.S. president for colluding with the Kremlin. “There’s no one in this world that [Trump] loves more than the Russian president,” said Snowden, who exposed eavesdropping by the National Security Agency five years ago and now lives in exile in Russia, a fugitive from U.S. espionage charges. “I think people are asking for too much when they hope that the Mueller investigation is going to come",|
"Barack Obama’s White House photographer has become a master of the image troll, using a photo to say so very much. In his latest zinger, Pete Souza takes aim at Donald Trump’s claim that the FBI, under orders of the Obama administration, planted a “spy” in his presidential campaign. So Souza posted on Instagram a funny, quirky photo of the former president bending down to peek through a peephole in a door as Obama’s personal secretary, Katie Johnson, looks on, smiling. The photo is captioned: “Learning to spy in 2009 with help from Katie Johnson.” As someone responded: “Well played.”",|
"Irish voters on Friday repealed the country’s eighth constitutional amendment, a decadeslong ban on abortion that had forced thousands of women to either illegally order abortion pills online or travel to the United Kingdom to access the procedure. A total of 1,429,981 voted for the repeal and 723,632 voted against, Returning Officer Barry Ryan said Saturday. The landmark referendum heralds a new era for women’s rights in a government that for centuries operated as a theocracy. Ireland’s parliament is now expected to write a more liberal law on the procedure, which will likely allow a woman to complete an abortion",|
"In January, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke traveled to Las Vegas to mingle at the SHOT Show, an annual gathering of the shooting, hunting and outdoor trade industries. The people there were “all great conservationists, really good people, dedicated to the outdoors,” he said in an interview with NRA-TV. An avid hunter and angler himself, Zinke has often said that the best stewards of wildlife are America’s sportsmen and -women. But after taking over the Department of the Interior in March 2017, he made quick work of angering some of those would-be supporters. Zinke and his team focused on boosting fossil",|
"President Donald Trump’s flagship Scottish golf resort in Turnberry pays its female employees less than men and has four times as many men as women in executive spots, according to an official filing with local authorities, The Scotsman reported. The mean rate for female pay at Trump Turnberry is 13.7 percent less than the pay for men, according to gender pay equality documents required by Scotland. So for every $1 men were paid, women got 86 cents. The average mean bonus paid to men was $4,414, which was nearly twice as much as the average bonus paid to women —",|
